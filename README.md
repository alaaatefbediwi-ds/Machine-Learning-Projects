## Project Idea & Motivation

This project was developed as part of the **Digitopia AI Competition**, conducted under the supervision of the **Ministry of Education and Communications.**

### Problem Statement

Many students struggle with choosing their future careers due to limited traditional counseling and lack of exposure to modern jobs. Most of them only know about a few professions such as doctor, engineer, or lawyer, while emerging fields like AI, sustainability, data science, or digital design remain unknown. When the time comes for them to make a career decision, they often feel lost, confused, and unsure of the right path to take.

### Our Solution (Career Compass)

Our team **InnoMinds** developed Career Compass, an AI-powered career guidance and job recommendation platform. It helps students and job seekers:
  - Explore a Jobs Library with responsibilities, required skills, and salary insights.
  - Receive personalized AI-powered recommendations based on their interests and queries.
  - Discover emerging job trends and align their skills with future opportunities.
Currently, the system implements the Recommendation Engine as the AI core. It acts as both a **Career Matcher** and a **Skill-to-Career Matcher**. Users can type in job roles (e.g., “Data Scientist”), skills (e.g., “Python, SQL”), or even a mix with industries/sectors (e.g., “Machine Learning + Healthcare”).

Then the system then analyzes the query, extracts key skills and context, and returns:
  - **Top 3 most relevant job recommendations** tailored to the query.
  - **Average salary** for each role.
  - **Responsibilities** and tasks associated with the role.
  - **Key skills** required to succeed.

This **makes Career Compass not only a job recommendation system but also a skill-driven career exploration tool**, bridging the gap between personal abilities and labor market needs.
