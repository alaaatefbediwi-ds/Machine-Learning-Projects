## Project Idea & Motivation

This project was developed as part of the **Digitopia AI Competition**, conducted under the supervision of the **Ministry of Education and Communications.**

### Problem Statement

Many students struggle with choosing their future careers due to limited traditional counseling and lack of exposure to modern jobs. Most of them only know about a few professions such as doctor, engineer, or lawyer, while emerging fields like AI, sustainability, data science, or digital design remain unknown. When the time comes for them to make a career decision, they often feel lost, confused, and unsure of the right path to take.

### Our Solution

Our team InnoMinds proposed a **Job Recommendation System** integrated into a mobile application.
The system allows users to enter a query about their desired career or job role, and it provides:
  - **Top 3 job recommendations** tailored to the query.
  - **Average salary** for each role.
  - **Responsibilities** associated with the role.
  - **Key skills** required to succeed in the role.

This solution is designed to bridge the gap between job seekers and the evolving demands of the labor market, helping individuals make informed career decisions with data-driven insights.
